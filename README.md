# Gerty App Support

Below is a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/davidtsadler/gerty-app-support/issues).

1. Answer to questions along the lines of "How do I... in Gerty" should be in the online documentation at [https://getgerty.com/guides/](https://getgerty.com/guides/). If you are unable to find a how-to guide in the online documentation, feel free to ask your question on the [Forum](#the-forum).

2. Before reporting an issue use the search feature on the issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it is hard to keep track of them or respond when the issues are solved. If you find your issue already reported, feel free to add "+1" reaction.

3. When reporting a new issue in the issue tracker, check whether it helps to answer the following questions:

   - Which Gerty App, Chrome and Operating System version you are using. You can check this out in the _About_ section.

   - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally?

   - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?

   - If it is a UI issue, a screenshot or GIF will help tremendously. (Tip: For quick gifs, check out [http://www.cockos.com/licecap/](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/))
